# Text Analytics Projects

Welcome to the Text Analytics Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects focused on text analytics, aimed at exploring various techniques, methodologies, and applications within the field.

## About

Text analytics, also known as text mining or natural language processing (NLP), is the process of deriving insights, patterns, and meaning from unstructured text data. It involves a range of tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, and more. This repository serves as a platform to showcase different text analytics projects, each addressing specific aspects of text analysis.

## Projects

1. ****: This project focuses on analyzing the sentiment expressed in text data. It involves classifying text into positive, negative, or neutral categories to understand the underlying sentiment.

2. **Topic Modeling**: In this project, we explore topic modeling techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify latent topics within a collection of documents.

3. **Text Classification**: Text classification involves categorizing text documents into predefined categories or labels. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning algorithms for text classification tasks.
