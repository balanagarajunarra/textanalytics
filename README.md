# Text Analytics Projects

Welcome to the Text Analytics Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of projects focused on text analytics, aimed at exploring various techniques, methodologies, and applications within the field.

## About

Text analytics, also known as text mining or natural language processing (NLP), is the process of deriving insights, patterns, and meaning from unstructured text data. It involves a range of tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, entity recognition, topic modeling, and more. This repository serves as a platform to showcase different text analytics projects, each addressing specific aspects of text analysis.

## Projects

1. **Text Similarity**: This project focuses on measuring the similarity between two or more pieces of text. It explores techniques such as cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, and more to quantify the similarity between documents, sentences, or words.

2. **Word Cloud**: In this project, we generate word clouds to visually represent the most frequent words in a corpus of text. Word clouds provide a quick and intuitive way to identify key themes, topics, or trends within a dataset.
